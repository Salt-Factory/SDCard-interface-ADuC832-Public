# SDCard-interface-ADuC832-Public
SDCard interface written in Assembly for the ADuC832.

SDCard interface written in Assembly to read and write to an SD-Card from an ADuC832 over a flat-cable using the SPI protocol.

This code can only be used didactically, seeing as there is hardware necessary to connect to the SD card.
The code is also dependend on a library that is not included in this repo, as it's not mine to share. 
All the comments are also in Dutch, I can't be bothered to switch them over for now.
